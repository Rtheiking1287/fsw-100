            <h3>What Music Is To Me</h3> <!--block-->
            <p>Music has always been important to me. Ever since I was a little kid, walking through the
              woods listening to old "Journey" cassettes, to staying up late to sneak videos on MTV and 
              VH1 late runs of Red Hot Chilli Peppers, Foo Fighters and such. To happy moments and sad 
              moments, music has accompanied them all. The day I got married and each day that I welcomed 
              a child to the world, to the days I have had to say final goodbyes to those I love until who 
              knows when. Music has, always been and will always be, there.</p> <!--block-->

            <h4>My Instruments</h4> <!--block-->
            <span>I have one electric guitar, one acoustic guitar, an electric bass guitar, and a electric drum set.
                I used to have a acoustic bass. Once my family moves, we will buy a regular drum set and new electric 
                guitar. I also would eventually love to get a keyboard and if I am <b>REALLY</b> dreaming big, an actual 
                piano. I am not the greatest at playing most or all of these instruments, but I work at it and continue 
                to teach my children as well. Nothing makes me happier than the sounds of organic music music being created 
                and played through every corner of the house.
